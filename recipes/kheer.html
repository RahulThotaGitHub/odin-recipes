<h2>Recipe for tasty kheer</h2>
<p>Kheer is a classic Indian rice pudding known for its creamy texture and rich flavor. Here's a basic recipe to get you started:

</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>4 cups full-fat milk</li>
<li>¼ to ½ cup basmati rice (or any other starchy rice)</li>
<li>4 to 6 tablespoons sugar (adjust to taste)</li>
<li>¼ to ½ teaspoon cardamom powder (or 2 to 3 cardamom pods)</li>
<li>10 cashews or 10 almonds (sliced or slivered)</li>
<li>10 pistachios (sliced or chopped)</li>
<li>A pinch of saffron (optional)</li>
<li>1 teaspoon rose water or kewra water (optional)</li>
<li>Raisins (optional)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Rinse the rice thoroughly.</li>
<li>In a pot or pressure cooker, combine rice, 1 cup of milk, and 1 cup of water. Cook the rice until soft. You can use 2 cups of milk altogether if using a pot and simmering until soft.</li>

<li>Pour in the remaining milk and bring it to a boil.</li>

<li>Lower the heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the milk thickens and reduces by half. The rice should be completely cooked and creamy.</li>

<li>Add sugar, cardamom powder, and nuts. Simmer for a few more minutes.</li>

<li>If using saffron, add a pinch and simmer for a minute to release the flavor.</li>

<li>For a richer taste, add rose water or kewra water (optional).</li>

<li>Adjust the consistency of the kheer by adding more milk for a thinner consistency or simmering longer for a thicker pudding.</li>


<li>Garnish with nuts, raisins (if using), and serve warm or chilled.</li>

</ol>
