<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Marinate the chicken:</strong> Make a marinade with yogurt, lemon juice, ginger garlic paste, green chili (if using), oil, salt, turmeric powder, red chili powder, biryani masala, coriander powder, roasted cumin powder, mint leaves, and coriander leaves. Apply the marinade to the chicken pieces, ensuring they are well coated. Let it sit for at least 30 minutes, or preferably overnight in the refrigerator.</li>
<li><strong>Cook the rice:</strong> Rinse the basmati rice and soak it in water for 30 minutes. In a pot, heat oil and add whole spices. Once fragrant, add the soaked rice, salt, and enough water to cover the rice by about an inch. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat, cover the pot, and simmer until the rice is about 70% cooked. The grains should still be a bit firm in the center.</li>
<li><Strong>Assemble the biryani:</strong> In a Dutch oven or a large pot, heat oil. Fry sliced onions until golden brown. Add the marinated chicken and cook until browned. Layer half of the cooked rice over the chicken, followed by saffron milk, biryani masala, mint leaves, and coriander leaves. Repeat the layers with the remaining rice and aromatics. Cover the pot tightly and seal the edges with dough or foil (optional) to trap steam.</li>
<li><strong>Cook the biryani:</strong> Cook the biryani on low heat for 20-25 minutes, or until the rice is fully cooked and fluffy.</li>
<li><strong>Garnish and serve:</strong> Let the biryani rest for 10 minutes before serving. Garnish with fried onions (optional) and enjoy!</li>
