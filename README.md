# odin-recipes
Odin recipes is a simple project which i am mainly making to showcase and solidfy my basic skills in HTML which i recently learned from The Odin Project . 
Odin recipes shows the recipes of the favourite dishes which my roommates like .
Through this project i learned how to make titles , headings , unordered and ordered lists , link images , link other webpages etc.
